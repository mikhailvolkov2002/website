    <h1>Altering the Subcoscious</h1>

    <h4 class="metadata">18:39 Nov 17th, 2024 | Mikhail Volkov</h5>

    <p>What I want, what anyone wants. Why do we want what we want, when we want it? 
    Can I change what I want, what made me want to change what I want? So many of our desires and choices are 
    influenced by external sources. These can be advertisements, our environment, the media and information that 
    we encounter, as well as our upbringing. Our personality, persona, and the image we uphold are not of our own creation, 
    we are not the authors of our thoughts. Your subconscious could change itself, but consciousness is unable. 
    </p>

    <p>We all act in accordance with what is “in character.” I don&#8217;t wake up at 5 every single morning 
    because that doesn&#8217;t mesh with my identity. For reasons beyond me, I identify somewhat as a 
    rebel, as a contrarian, who doesn&#8217;t care for rules or authority. This is due to a plethora of 
    factors previously mentioned. I am also a natural skeptic, and don&#8217;t think I should believe 
    in anything for poor reasons, such as duty or obligation. 
    </p>

    <p>There are some things I would like to change about myself, and have thus far been unable to do so. 
    For example, I&#8217;d like to act more mature. I am incessantly goofy and unserious. If I wanted 
    to change this there are certain things I would do. 
    </p>

    <p>First, I&#8217;d write down some affirmations, and read them multiple times a day, but at least twice, 
    once after waking up, and once before bed. Such an affirmation could be extremely simple, such as 
    </p>

    <p>“I am a serious individual, I don&#8217;t make crude, silly, goofy, or unbecoming jokes, and because
    of this people take me very seriously and respect me.”
    </p>

    <p>I also believe that changing your physical image as well as physical location can help 
    with changing your persona/identity. For example, after establishing what it is you would 
    like to change, you could get a drastic haircut. This would symbolize the death of your former 
    self, and the start of someone new, who acts in accordance with their new character. 
    This could also be achieved through physical location, interacting with new people, or some 
    sort of ritual that represents a new beginning.
    </p>

    <p>The subconscious is the most powerful tool we have in our arsenal. If we can 
    control that, and mold it to our liking, nothing can stop us from achieving 
    what we so desire. For example, in distance running, what holds most runners 
    back is not their physical conditioning, but their mental blocks. I recall 
    my freshman year of highschool, when I was 14 years old. My workouts indicated 
    I was in better shape than the times I was running in races. I broke through 
    this mental block, not by altering my subconscious, but through brute force. 
    I went out in a 1600m race, at a pace that was 15 seconds faster than my best 
    time. (PR at the time was around a 4:55, I went out at 70s a lap, or 4:40 pace) 
    My coach had come up with this plan, and he instructed me was to only focus on 
    making it through three of the four laps at that 4:40 pace, then whatever 
    happens on the last lap, is not important. I thought that I would burn out, 
    and run a 1:20 or worse on this final lap, but my coach didn&#8217;t think so, 
    thinking that there was no way I&#8217;d run slower than 1:15 (75) on this last lap. 
    My coach was correct, I ran a 1:14 (74) and set a new record time in the 1600m 
    at 4:44
    </p>

    <p>This makes me question my true potential. Or anyone&#8217;s true potential. It would 
    seem that only mentally disturbed people make it to the very top of many athletic 
    events. Gerry Lindgren, did not come off as talented to anyone close to him 
    for any sports. He was abused as a kid, and when first starting cross country, 
    he was at the very back of the pack, but not knowing any training, or 
    performance norms, he started running well over 150 miles a week, and 
    becoming the greatest highschool distance runner of all time. He was also 
    abused as a child.
    </p>

    <p>I hypothesize that had he known about training norms, and had not been subject 
    to abuse, he wouldn&#8217;t have achieved near the heights he reached in running. 
    I believe he would have been good, but nowhere near great. So I ask myself, 
    what can I, someone who I believe was endowed with natural talent for running, 
    achieve?
    </p>

    <p>If you see it, you can believe it. That is what I think. Right now, I can&#8217;t 
    fathom me running a sub 4 minute mile, or running a sub 14 minute 5k. But 
    if I want to make strides towards my goals, I need to see myself as capable 
    of these things. Not just to where I believe that I can stretch and just barely 
    get it, but to the point where I expect it, and I&#8217;d be much more shocked if 
    I didn&#8217;t get my desired time.
