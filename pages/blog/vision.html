    <h1>On Having a Vision</h1>
    <h4 class="metadata">0:24 Nov 19th, 2024 | Mikhail Volkov</h4>

    <p>Begin with the end in mind. I heard this quote long ago, and it has stuck with me
    ever since. In order to take steps towards where we are going, we need to know where 
    it is we want to go. We need to create a vision for ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>Jordan Peterson talks about an exercise that he had clients and students do, where
    they would think about what their life would look like in 5 years, if they got their
    act together. Then they would write what that would be, going into great detail on how
    their day-to-day life would go, how they would act, who they would be with, what job
    they would have, what car they would drive, etcetera.
    </p>

    <p>I believe that in order to make great strides towards becoming someone you want to be,
    you should have a vision for yourself. Then ask yourself what it would take to get there.
    I was recently listening to a podcast on the early days of the company SpaceX, and how Elon
    Musk recruited great talent to work for him, and how they would tackle large problems. He would
    ask his team to do something thought to be impossible, then when they would object, he would 
    ask them:
    </p>

    <p>"What would it take?"</p>

    <p>Create a vision for yourself, ask the impossible of yourself, and then ask yourself
    that same question.
    </p>

    <p>"What would it take?"</p>

    <p>I will do this exercise myself. I will have a shorter timeline than 5 years, possibly
    one year. This is because I am impatient.
    </p>

    <p>I'm still working on this blog post.</p>
